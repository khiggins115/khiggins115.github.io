                            <!--<img style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;" src="assets/img/face_mask_example.png" width=400/>-->
                            <p>Deaths from self harm (i.e. suicide and other intentional injuries that result in death) far outpace other mortality categories in the IMHE dataset. 
                                Given that alcohol abuse is an established factor in many diseases and mental/behavioral health disorders, I aimed to create supervised and unsupervised model(s) 
                                to that explore the relationships between mortality rate by self-harm, and the prevalence of alcohol use/abuse in a given county and other variables such as sex, year, state and unemployment
                                in an effort to establish the strength of those relationships.<br></br>
                                Because this project was exploratory in nature, I focused mainly on insights that could be derived. Using unsupervised learning models in this project
                                was particularly interesting as it identified counties that were similarly burdened with high levels of both binge drinking behaviors and high self-harm
                                mortality rates. 
                                <br></br>

                            <p>As part of a group project, we demonstrated how one might collect, clean, aggregate and visualize various open data sources, with a specific focus
                                on public health and government/census/demographic datasets.
                                Using Texas as our "case study" state, we built out a streamlit application that allowed users to visualize county level choropleths representing mortality rates for various diseases
                                from 1980 through 2014. This practice creating an interactive application for exploring data was an informative exercise that empowered us with the knowledge and experience
                                to create dashboards for future projects. We also gained valuable experience working with map objects in python.

                            <p>Reddit, also known as the "front page of the internet" is a popular "American social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website" (Wikipedia). 
                                Topics for discussion are typically organized into "subreddits" where users post relevant news/info/questions. In recent years, 
                                Reddit has also become known less for the intellectually spirited discourses that it claims to foster and more as a breeding ground 
                                for the proliferation of conspiracy theories. But how do we distill thought exercises from conspiracy theories? Can we distinguish between
                                them? This project uses Natural Language Processing and Text classification in an attempt to do just that. <br></br>

                                I scraped r/conspiracy and r/C_S_T ("Critical Shower Thoughts") for subset of random samples of posts from each thread and, after cleaning and exploring
                                the data, iterated through several Bayesian and non-Bayesian classification models. While a ComplementNB model yielded the best test accuracy score at 76%, for 
                                the sake of interpretability I preferred the Logistic Regression model, which returned only a slightly lower test accuracy score of 72%.

                            <p>Undertaken as a project in collaboration with a graduate student intern for the American Red Cross's GIS Team in the summer of 2016, 
                                this interactive web map represented a summer project to research the completeness of OpenStreetMap contributions up to that point.
                                This responsive dashboard was hand-coded using HTML, CSS and Javascript, as well as the Leaflet.js and D3.js libraries for the mapping functionality. <br></br>

                                I am especially proud of this project (though it is by no means perfect - reflective of my skills at the time), as I was required to step outside the box of the specific GIS tools and technologies that 
                                my degree program taught and learn new ways of gathering, processing, analyzing and visualizing spatial data. I am forever shaped by my experience working for the American Red Cross GIS Team,
                                as it was there that I was introduced to and became enamored with the capacity for data to serve altruistic and humanitarian interests.

                    <p>A few of my professional interests include spatial data science, geography, public health & demographic data, 
                        data visualization, natural language processing, and the intersection of data science & public policy.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">In my free time I enjoy reading, cooking, doing the crossword, stand-up comedy, spending time with my dog
                        and writing/performing slam poetry.</p>
